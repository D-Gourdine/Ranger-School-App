    <h1>About Ranger School</h1>
    <p>
        Ranger School is one of the toughest training courses for which a Soldier can volunteer. Army Rangers are experts in leading Soldiers on difficult missions - and to do this, they need rigorous training. For more than two months, Ranger students train to exhaustion, pushing the limits of their minds and bodies.

        A key task in "RAP" (Ranger Assessment Phase) Week is completing Ranger Task Training, which consists of 5 different events.
