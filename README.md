Ranger School is one of the toughest training courses for which a Soldier can volunteer. Army Rangers are experts in leading Soldiers on difficult missions - and to do this, they need rigorous training. For more than two months, Ranger students train to exhaustion, pushing the limits of their minds and bodies.

This app will help prepare future Rangers for the rigors of Ranger School.

* About Ranger School and Ranger School Phases
  * Ranger Assessment Phase, Darby Phase, Mountain Phase, Florida Phase
