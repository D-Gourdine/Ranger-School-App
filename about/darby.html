        <h1>Phase 1: Darby</h1>
    
    <p>The <b>Darby Phase</b> is the first and arguably the most challenging phase of the U.S. Army Ranger School, conducted at Fort Moore, Georgia.
    
    <p>The Darby Phase is intentionally demanding, with a high attrition rate. Soldiers who persevere through this phase develop the foundation and mindset necessary to succeed in the subsequent phases of Ranger School and become elite members of the U.S. Army.</p>
        
    <p>It's a grueling 21-day period designed to assess and develop a soldier's:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Physical Stamina:</b> Expect to be pushed to your physical limits through constant activity, carrying heavy loads, and operating on minimal sleep.</li>

        <li><b>Individual Soldier Tasks:</b> To be a Ranger qualified leader, a soldier must be able to achieve standards at an individual level to earn the privilege to lead others. You cannot expect your soldiers to do what you cannot do yourself.</li>

        <li><b>Mental Toughness:</b> The Darby Phase is known for its demanding mental challenges, including sleep deprivation, constant evaluation, and high stress situations.</li>

        <li><b>Leadership Skills:</b> Soldiers are given opportunities to lead fireteams and squads, learning to make sound decisions under pressure and inspire their fellow soldiers.</li>

        <li><b>Tactical Fundamentals:</b> The phase establishes the foundation for follow-on training by teaching soldiers essential combat skills like patrolling, formations, communication, and marksmanship.</li>
    </ul>


        <br>
        <p>The Darby Phase is divided into two parts:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><b>Ranger Assessment Phase (RAP Week):</b> This week focuses on individual soldier proficiency through a series of physical and mental tests.</li>

        <li><b>Patrolling Phase:</b> This phase focuses on squad-level operations, with soldiers conducting simulated combat patrols, practicing ambushes and reconnaissance, and learning to operate patrol bases. They are constantly evaluated on their leadership, decision-making, and ability to function under pressure.</li>
        </ol>
