    <h1>Phase 2: Mountains</h1>
    <p>The <b>Mountain Phase</b> of Ranger School, held at Camp Merrill in Dahlonega, Georgia, is widely considered the most physically and mentally demanding phase of the entire program.</p>
    
    <p>The Mountain Phase is notorious for its harsh weather conditions, sleep deprivation, and relentless training schedule. It's designed to build mental and physical resilience, foster teamwork, and prepare soldiers to operate effectively in challenging mountain environments.</p>

    <p>It's a 20-day period focused on developing:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Mountain Warfare Skills:</b> Students learn specialized techniques for navigating, climbing, and fighting in mountainous terrain. This includes rope work, rappelling, building shelters, and employing tactical maneuvers in a mountainous environment.</li> 
        <li><b>Platoon-Level Leadership:</b> The focus shifts from squad-level leadership in Darby Phase to leading and operating as a platoon. Students practice planning and executing complex missions, coordinating fire support, and making tactical decisions under pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Resilience and Teamwork:</b> The harsh conditions and constant stress test the students' physical and mental fortitude. They learn to rely on their teammates, overcome exhaustion and hardship, and push themselves beyond their perceived limits.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
        <p>Here's a breakdown of the Mountain Phase structure:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><b>Lower and Upper Mountaineering:</b> This initial phase focuses on fundamental mountaineering skills in a controlled environment. Students learn knots, belaying, rappelling, climbing techniques, and safe rope management. They culminate this phase with a challenging climb on Yonah Mountain, testing their newly acquired skills and confidence.</li>
        
        <li><b>Mountain Techniques:</b> This phase dives deeper into specialized mountain warfare tactics, including:</li>

            <ul class="ul2">
                <li><b>Mobility:</b> Techniques for traversing difficult terrain, utilizing ropes for crossing obstacles, and establishing and dismantling rappelling systems.</li>
                <li><b>Field Expedients:</b> Students learn to improvise shelters, build bridges, and overcome various obstacles using limited resources.</li>
                <li><b>Demolitions:</b> Safe handling and application of explosives for breaching obstacles and creating defensive positions.</li>
            </ul>

        <li><b>Tactical Operations:</b> The final phase integrates all the learned skills into a culminating field training exercise (FTX). Students conduct complex platoon-level missions in a simulated combat environment, applying their mountain warfare and leadership skills under realistic pressure.</li>
        </ul>
