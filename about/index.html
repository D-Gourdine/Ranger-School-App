    <h1>About Ranger School</h1>

    <p>Ranger School is one of the toughest training courses for which a Soldier can volunteer. Army Rangers are experts in leading Soldiers on difficult missions - and to do this, they need rigorous training. For more than two months, Ranger students train to exhaustion, pushing the limits of their minds and bodies.</p>

    <p>This app will help prepare Ranger candidates for RAP Week, the different phases and outline the standards required to successfuly complete Ranger School.</p>

    <p>If you would like administrative information on the course, please visit <a href="https://www.moore.army.mil/infantry/artb/Student-Information/index.html">Fort Moore's Ranger School page</a>, which covers class information & reporting, packing list items, medical, and more.</p>
